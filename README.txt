This prolog script is made to solve the following problem:

A river has a north bank and a south bank. On the north bank there is a farmer with a wolf, a goat, a cabbage, and a bag of fertilizer. The farmer’s goal is to transport all of these items and himself to the south bank. He can cross the river in a boat, either alone or accompanied by just one other item. However, it is not safe to leave behind the wolf with the goat, as the wolf might eat the goat if the farmer is not present. Likewise, it is not safe to leave behind the goat with the cabbage as the goat might eat the cabbage. The farmer will therefore have to make several crossings back and forth, in such a way that all items get transported and nothing gets eaten. The wolf will not eat the cabbage, and neither the wolf nor the goat will eat the bag of fertilizer.
